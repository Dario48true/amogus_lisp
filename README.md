## Submission Requirements
- Must print only `ඞ amogus`
  - Newlines are allowed and prefered, however, keep it to one please.
- Should be named `ඞ.<extension>`
  - I.E, `ඞ.py, ඞ.rs, ඞ.c, etc`
- The language you used, added to `LANGLIST.md`, preferably in alphabetical order.
  - Will still merge without it, but it would be great if you can do it.
- Joke submissions should go in the `joke` folder.
  - I.E: non-programming languages and/or twisting of the rules.
    - Files such as `JPG`, `PNG`, `TXT`, etc.
    - Scripts that print `ඞ amogus` `x` amount of times.
- Non-joke submissions should go in the `lang` folder.
  - **Any language that is, at the very least, usable to print a string.**

We will request changes on your submission if: 
- These conditions aren't met.
- We find it's not suitable for the repository in its current state.

**If your submission is offensive in any way, it will be denied on sight, without hesitation.**

**As these files are basically just "Hello, world!" but for "ඞ amogus", all contributions will be licensed under the "[Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)" license. If you do not like this, then do not contribute. This may be subject to change.**
