# GDScript
## Notes
- A complete godot 4.x project is in /misc to avoid having to deal with everything I will mention below.
- This script will not simply work by attaching to any node, as it does not inherit from the node class.
As such, to print an amogus by running in the editor, you need to have a node (any node type) with a script attached, which instances a new ඞ.gd.
