The primary goal of The Impostor(s) is to kill enough Crewmates to have an equal amount of Impostors and Crewmates before all tasks are completed.

The Impostor numbers shown in red when creating a game to host.

All Impostors cannot complete any tasks; however, they are given a fake task list as general guidance on feigning a Crewmate's behavior and blending in with them. Impostors have the ability to Sabotage to force Crewmates to resolve issues, with some killing all Crewmates if not resolved in time. This ability can be used in many different ways, such as luring Crewmates away from a body or concealing a kill.

There are two ways for Impostors to win:

Crewmates being eliminated by leaving, being killed, or being ejected until they no longer have a voting majority (one Crewmate per Impostor left). Enacting a critical Sabotage that is not resolved in time. Impostors primarily eliminate Crewmates through a combination of killing them during gameplay and manipulating or confusing the Crew into ejecting innocent players. Crewmates leaving, disconnecting, or being kicked from the game also contribute towards this goal.
